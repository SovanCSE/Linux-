1. echo: “echo” is a command that helps us move some data, 
         usually text into a file. For example, if you want
         to create a new text file or add into an already made text 
         file, then you just need to type in “echo hello, my name is alok >> new.txt”.
         You do not need to separate the spaces by using the backward slash here
          because we put in two triangular brackets when we finish what we need to write.
Example:(It help to move some data to a exiting file or create a file)
>echo hello, my name is Sovan >> new.txt

2.cat: The cat command is used to display the contents of a file, 
          usually used to easily view programs.

Example:
>cat next.txt
Output :hello, my name is Sovan
